# Shopify Product CSVs and Images

Update: To populate Shopify development stores with sample products, we recommend using test data that can be generated when you create new development stores through the partner dashboard. The generated test data set includes the most common commerce primitives and configurations that you need to test an app, theme, or custom storefront, including some Plus-specific features. Read the [developer documentation](https://shopify.dev/docs/apps/tools/development-stores/generated-data) for more information on generated test data.

Shopify is a powerful platform, which makes it easy to build a beautiful online store quickly. One way to make that process even quicker is importing products via CSV. A CSV file, also known as comma-separated values file, stores tabular data (numbers and text) as plain text. Importing product data via CSV can speed up your design or development process by providing data to populate your store quicklyâ€”instead of copying and pasting lorem-ipsum text into product descriptions, and searching for photos.
